# Credit Card Fraud Detection 🕵️‍♀️💳

This project uses machine learning in Python to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a real-world dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Features are anonymized using PCA
- Highly imbalanced dataset (0.17% fraud cases)

## 🔍 Techniques Used
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- SMOTE for handling class imbalance
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Model evaluation using ROC AUC, F1-score, Precision, Recall

## 🧠 Goal
To build a reliable fraud detection model that minimizes false negatives while maintaining high precision.
